# My .dotfiles

For configuring mystuff.

Really just putting these up becase the apple store is about to tear apart my machine and I want to have them saved somewhere.

Use Iterm2, make sure to load base16 color scheme or whatever from here: https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-iterm2

and DO NOT use the 256 color scheme variation. For some reason it fucks up all the colors.
